        <h2>Aluminium Wheel-Chair</h2>
        <p>
          A manual wheelchair is powered either by the individual using the
          wheelchair or by an assistant. The most commonly recognized manual
          wheelchairs are seen at hospitals and nursing homes. Individuals who
          have the strength and endurance to independently propel the wheelchair
          typically use manual wheelchairs. They can propel the wheelchair in
          different ways. For instance, individuals with a spinal cord injury
          can use their upper extremities. Individuals who have had a stroke
          that affects only one side of the body can use one upper extremity and
          one lower extremity. Individuals who have neither the strength to walk
          without a walker or cane nor the endurance to walk with one can use
          their lower extremities. An assistant or attendant propels the manual
          wheelchair when individuals cannot do it themselves.
